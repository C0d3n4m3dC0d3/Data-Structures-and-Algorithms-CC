Two ways to traverse trees:
	1. DFS - Depth First Search - using Stack
	2. BFS - Breadth First Search - using Queue

Types of Tree Traversals:
	1. Inorder - LeftSelfRight
	2. Preorder - SelfLeftRight
	3. Postorder - LeftRightSelf

Construction of trees with traversal pattern:
	pre+in = unique tree can be constructed
	post+in = unique tree can be constructed
	post+pre = unique tree cannot be constructed

Applications of Trees:
	1. Vision Tree Classifier
	2. Heirarchy
	3. Parse Tree

Binary Tree is like a tree
A node can have only two children
left child and right child are explicitly marked
can have either a left child, or a right child or both

Features of Trees:
	1. Root node does not have a parent
	2. All other nodes have only a single parent
	3. No cycles
